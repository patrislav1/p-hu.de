# Double exposure with Olympus XA

Throwback to 12/2009. Shot with Olympus XA in Bern, CH.

Since the XA doesn't do double exposure, this was kind of a gamble. First shoot a batch of 36 random photos, then rewind the whole roll, then shoot the second batch of 36 photos.
Ended up with 35 garbage photos and this one. ðŸ˜‚
