# Ride of Silence for Natenom in Hamburg

Today the [ADFC Hamburg](https://hamburg.adfc.de/) organized a Ride of Silence
for Andreas Mandalka, nickname [Natenom](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natenom),
who was killed on the road on 30.01.2024.

Mandalka, who lived and died in the Pforzheim area, was hit from behind by a driver
at high speed and died on the spot. He didn't have a chance.

Here in Hamburg there are similar memorial services with "die-ins" and ghostbikes several times a year.
Cyclists are killed constantly here - which is unsurprising, considering Hamburg's car-centric traffic planning
& transport politics, poor infrastructure, and on the motorists' side a mix of stress, impatience
and contempt for vulnerable road users.

What makes Mandalka's killing special (I refuse to call it an *accident* for reasons cited below),
and spawned dozens of spontaneous demonstrations and multiple "rides of silence" across the country,
is that he spent his life fighting for equal rights for cyclists, documenting dangerous spots,
being mobbed by motorists (esp. through "punishment passes", a.k.a. being overtaken without
due safety distance) - and repeatedly being ignored and dismissed by police and authorities in spite of
his meticulous documentation.

He was mobbed and laughed at by the very institutions who were supposed to protect him and his rights
as a fellow road user, and in a twist of the most cruel and bitter irony, he was finally killed
on the same road about whose danger he had warned for years.

## There Are No Accidents

There is
[a brilliant podcast interview](https://thewaroncars.org/2022/02/15/there-are-no-accidents-with-jessie-singer)
with author Jessie Singer who wrote the book "There Are No Accidents".
After her dear friend was killed by a drunk driver, she began to research so-called accidents.
She found out that contrary to the word, which implies a totally random event,
"accidents" are not evenly distributed in the population. They disproportionately affect
disadvantaged groups, such as people who are less well off, people of color, etc.

Singer suggests that "accidents" are not random, but the result of a system that puts underprivileged
people at risk. The very word is a red herring to distract from
the fact that these kind of risks are not god-given or *force majeure*, but a result of deliberate choices.

### Who is to blame?

Singer makes it clear that putting blame on the individual perpetrators not only doesn't solve the problem,
but **actively prevents** the necessary solution / correction on the systemic level.

Even though we are overwhelmed with grief and anger, we should do our best to direct our frustration
at the politicans, authorities and institutions who perpetuate motorist supremacy, not at the motorists
themselves.

"The system has failed them too", Singer says, and I believe there is a lot of wisdom in that.
