# About

Hi, I'm Patrick. This is my personal, non-commercial blog.

I write about stuff I enjoy and things I want to save for later lookup.
This includes programming, cooking, cycling, photography, books, music etc.

Also I liked the idea of creating an old-school, human-readable website without consent banners and SEO junk.

## Technical information

This website is based on [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
which is a great framework to build static websites with very little effort.
I already used it a lot for technical documentation, then found out it's also capable of
running a blog with the built-in [blog plugin](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/blog/).

The source code of this website is [on GitHub](https://github.com/patrislav1/p-hu.de) and gets built with a GitHub CI workflow.

### Privacy

This website doesn't use cookies and doesn't embed external resources.
It uses [mkdocs-material privacy plugin](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/ensuring-data-privacy/#built-in-privacy-plugin),
so I don't get sued for using Google Fonts. ðŸ¤£
